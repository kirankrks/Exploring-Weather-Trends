# Exploring-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: Project 1


Summary

In this project, I analysed the local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live (Melbourne, Australia) to the overall global temperature trends.




Steps

The goal of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. This was done by the following steps below:

•	Extract the data from the database by writing a SQL query and export them to CSV. Data extraction includes temperature data for the world Melbourne, Australia

•	Open up the CSV in using Excel 

•	Create a line chart that compares Melbourne’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Plotting was done using the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable

•	Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Melbourne’s averages, as well as overall trends. 




Project submission is a PDF file that includes:

•	An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:

o	Tools  used for each step ( SQL, Excel)

o	How was the moving average calculated?

o	What were the key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?



•	Line chart with local and global temperature trends

•	At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
